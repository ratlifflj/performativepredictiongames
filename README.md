# performativepredictiongames
Code for synthetic and semisynthetic experiments on multiplayer performative prediction games. 

This repository at present contains a semi-synthetic simulation environment for revenue maximization in ride-share games using data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma). It also contains a sythetic simulation environment for multiplayer strategic prediciton wherein the user can generate random instances of the problem. 

### Utils Folder
Contains utilities files for the ride-share (revenue maximization) and strategic prediction problems.

### Jpyntbks Folder
Constains the Jupyter notebooks for running the examples. 

### Data folder
Contains saved parameters which can be updated using the code in the utilies files.
